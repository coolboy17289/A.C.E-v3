# A.C.E OS - Academic Companion Engine OS

A lightweight Linux-based operating system for Raspberry Pi, designed specifically for students. A.C.E OS combines a minimal Linux base with a custom React + TypeScript desktop environment to deliver a complete educational computing experience.

## Architecture

A.C.E OS is built as a tiered system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         A.C.E React Desktop Environment         │
│  (Apps, UI, Productivity, AI Features)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│      A.C.E Backend API (Node.js + SQLite)       │
│  (Tasks, Calendar, Settings, Hardware)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   A.C.E Hardware Services (Linux Daemons)       │
│  (Camera, GPIO, AI, Sync)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Linux Base (Raspberry Pi OS Lite ARM64)       │
│  (Drivers, Networking, Storage)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Mode
```bash
# Start backend (terminal 1)
npm run dev:backend

# Start desktop shell (terminal 2)
npm run dev:shell
```

The desktop shell will open at `http://localhost:5173` in Chromium kiosk mode.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Raspberry Pi Deployment

See [`system/linux-config/INSTALL.md`](system/linux-config/INSTALL.md) for full deployment instructions to Raspberry Pi hardware.

## Applications

2. **Planner** — Calendar, assignments, exams, timetable
3. **Tasks** — Task management with priorities & categories
4. **Subjects** — Subject list, notes, revision tracking
5. **Focus** — Pomodoro timer & study sessions
6. **AI** — AI learning assistant (Ollama/llama.cpp)
7. **Statistics** — Learning analytics & trends
8. **Settings** — System, theme, hardware, network

Note using claude for debugging 
Update pushing v1.2.0 --beta with kind of working gui
   Note: this will be the 4th push for this project 
   Note; 5 errors 
Update: timestamp jul 15 1733 hr claude code found the erros but just makeing them worst somehow 
   Note this is what claude code said # Developer Notes #2: Major Errors and Debugging Challenges

During the latest stage of development, I encountered two major errors that have become significant blockers. After spending time investigating the issues, testing possible solutions, and reviewing the code, I have not yet been able to determine the exact cause.

These errors have slowed development progress, but they have also provided useful opportunities to learn more about the system and identify areas that may need improvement. Debugging complex problems is a normal part of software development, even if it sometimes feels like the code has decided to fight back for no logical reason.

At this stage, I may use additional debugging tools, including Claude Code, to help analyse the issues and speed up the troubleshooting process. The goal is not just to find a quick fix, but to understand the underlying cause and make sure the solution is reliable.

Further updates will be added once more information is discovered, including the root cause of the errors, the debugging process, and the final fixes implemented.
Update:
       New push no version update comminted claude code fixis
                                                             Timestamp: jul 1510 hrs  
Update: version 1.2.1 --beta is now being pushed timespame jul 15 1829 hr
