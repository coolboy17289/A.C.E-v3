# A.C.E OS - Academic Companion Engine OS

A lightweight Linux-based operating system for Raspberry Pi, designed specifically for students. A.C.E OS combines a minimal Linux base with a custom React + TypeScript desktop environment to deliver a complete educational computing experience.

## Architecture

A.C.E OS is built as a tiered system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         A.C.E React Desktop Environment         │
│  (Apps, UI, Productivity, AI Features)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│      A.C.E Backend API (Node.js + SQLite)       │
│  (Tasks, Calendar, Settings, Hardware)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   A.C.E Hardware Services (Linux Daemons)       │
│  (Camera, GPIO, AI, Sync)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Linux Base (Raspberry Pi OS Lite ARM64)       │
│  (Drivers, Networking, Storage)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```

## Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Mode
```bash
# Start backend (terminal 1)
npm run dev:backend

# Start desktop shell (terminal 2)
npm run dev:shell
```

The desktop shell will open at `http://localhost:5173` in Chromium kiosk mode.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Port shells (alternative front-ends)

A.C.E OS exposes a JSON API from `backend/` on port `4318`. Anything
that can speak `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/users/me` can be a
front-end. Beyond the React/Vite SPA that ships by default
(`frontend/desktop-shell/`), six alternative front-ends live in this
repo:

| Stack      | Path                       | Native on Pi? | Boot speed vs Chromium kiosk |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Next.js    | `frontend/nextjs/`         | no (still Chromium) | faster FCP, otherwise equivalent |
| Rust+Iced  | `frontend/rust-iced/`      | yes (`iced 0.13` over Wayland/X11) | **~80ms** cold start |
| Rust+Slint | `frontend/rust-slint/`     | yes (Slint renderer) | **~60ms** cold start, smallest binary |
| C++ / Qt 6 | `frontend/cpp-qt/`         | yes (Qt Widgets) | **~150ms** cold start |
| Java + JavaFX | `frontend/java-javafx/` | yes (JDK 17 + OpenJFX) | **~600ms** cold start (JVM warmup) |
| C + GTK4   | `frontend/c-gtk4/`         | yes (Wayland native) | **~50ms** cold start |

Each port has its own `README.md` with prerequisites + a build/run
recipe. To get all six running side-by-side against the same backend:

```bash
npm run dev:backend            # terminal 1
./scripts/dev-all.sh           # terminal 2 (tmux dashboard)
```

Or pick and choose:

```bash
npm run shell:nextjs:dev
npm run shell:rust-iced:check
npm run shell:cpp-qt:build
npm run shell:java-javafx:run
npm run shell:c-gtk4:build && npm run shell:c-gtk4:run
```

`scripts/verify-shells.mjs` (`npm run shells:verify`) is a smoke test
that hits the two shared endpoints and asserts the JSON shape the
shells rely on — useful in CI before kicking off cross-compilation.

### MVP scope (intentionally narrow)

Every port's MVP is a single window with three label rows + a Refresh
button: `Backend:` (`/api/health`), `User:` (`/api/users/me`), plus a
timestamp. None of them reimplements the React dashboard; they exist
to validate end-to-end plumbing (HTTP → parsing → render → click). To
port full features, follow the per-stack READMEs as the entry point.

## Raspberry Pi Deployment

See [`system/linux-config/INSTALL.md`](system/linux-config/INSTALL.md) for full deployment instructions to Raspberry Pi hardware.

### Boot splash + cross-compiled kernel

A.C.E OS layers a custom Plymouth boot splash over the Pi's
framebuffer so the first 25 s of boot shows an A.C.E wordmark rather
than the rainbow square + Linux console. The kernel itself is
**cross-compiled inside the Docker image build** (Stage 0 of
`later/os/build/Dockerfile`) against the `rpi-6.6.y` LTS branch with
an A.C.E kconfig overlay.

| Folder | Why it exists |
|--------|---------------|
| `system/boot/splash.svg`           | Canonical wordmark, rasterized at build time |
| `system/boot/config.txt`           | Suppress rainbow, enable KMS for Plymouth + Wayland |
| `system/boot/cmdline.txt`          | `quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles …` |
| `system/boot/plymouth/theme/ace.*` | Plymouth `script`-plugin agent + theme metadata |
| `system/boot/install-plymouth.sh`  | Theme registration + `update-initramfs` rebuild |
| `system/linux-config/kernel/`      | Cross-compile driver + kconfig fragment |

Helpful npm scripts (see `package.json`):

```bash
npm run os:boot:render       # locally rasterize splash.svg → PNGs
npm run os:boot:install-local # install Plymouth theme on this host (debug)
npm run os:kernel:check      # sanity check fragment + script present
npm run os:kernel:build      # run build-kernel.sh standalone (debug)
npm run os:image:build       # full Docker image (kernel + rootfs + Plymouth)
```

Why Plymouth over `config.txt` splash: the Pi's KMS driver (vc4-kms-v3d)
replaces the framebuffer firmware splash half-way through boot, so any
`config.txt` "splash image" flickers. Plymouth owns the DRM device for
the entire `initramfs → KMS → X/Wayland → desktop` window.

   Note; 5 errors 
Update: timestamp jul 15 1733 hr claude code found the erros but just makeing them worst somehow 
   Note this is what claude code said # Developer Notes #2: Major Errors and Debugging Challenges

During the latest stage of development, I encountered two major errors that have become significant blockers. After spending time investigating the issues, testing possible solutions, and reviewing the code, I have not yet been able to determine the exact cause.

These errors have slowed development progress, but they have also provided useful opportunities to learn more about the system and identify areas that may need improvement. Debugging complex problems is a normal part of software development, even if it sometimes feels like the code has decided to fight back for no logical reason.

At this stage, I may use additional debugging tools, including Claude Code, to help analyse the issues and speed up the troubleshooting process. The goal is not just to find a quick fix, but to understand the underlying cause and make sure the solution is reliable.

Further updates will be added once more information is discovered, including the root cause of the errors, the debugging process, and the final fixes implemented.
Update:
       New push no version update comminted claude code fixis
                                                             Timestamp: jul 1510 hrs
