# Changelog

All notable changes to A.C.E OS are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - In progress

The v2 --beta release is a full re-code of the codebase for stronger
TypeScript posture, better cold-boot behaviour, and a kiosk-first
touch UX. It lands four touch-first apps, a first-setup wizard, and a
flashable image installer on top of the v1 Settings + AI Tutor + Focus
surface.

### Added

- `@ace/design-system` — touch-first primitives: `TouchButton`,
  `Card`, `IconButton`, `VirtualKeyboard`, `ThemeProvider`, palette,
  and an 8 px spacing scale.
- `@ace/desktop-shell` — single-app Vite + React shell that hosts
  the Setup Wizard and the Dashboard. Manual `manualChunks` for
  per-app dynamic imports.
- `@ace/app-home` — touch-friendly launchpad and today overview.
- `@ace/app-tasks` — touch-managed task lists.
- `@ace/app-focus` — Pomodoro timer.
- `@ace/app-settings` — theme, network, and system actions.
- First-setup wizard: 5 steps (Language, Connectivity, Profile,
  Theme, Done), gated on `GET /api/system/setup-state`.
- `POST /api/system/setup-state` and `POST /api/system/setup-reset`
  routes, with the wizard state persisted to
  `/var/lib/ace/setup.json` (overridable via `ACE_SETUP_FILE`).
- Image installer scripts under `scripts/installer/`:
  - `build-image.sh` — base Raspbian + A.C.E overlay.
  - `flash.sh` — verifies SHA-256, 10 s countdown, `dd bs=4M conv=fsync`.
- Custom Plymouth boot splash (owning the DRM device through
  `initramfs → KMS → X/Wayland → desktop`) so the first ~25 s of
  boot shows the A.C.E wordmark instead of the rainbow square.
- Cross-compiled kernel recipe in `system/linux-config/kernel/`
  (Stage 0 of `later/os/build/Dockerfile`) against `rpi-6.6.y` with
  an A.C.E kconfig overlay.
- Six alternative front-end ports (Native Frontend Ports) — Next.js,
  Rust + Iced, Rust + Slint, C++ + Qt 6, Java + JavaFX, and C +
  GTK4. All target the same JSON API at `/api/health` and
  `/api/users/me`.
- Top-level C-daemon `Makefile` wrapping the per-module trees
  (`make`, `make daemon`, `make focus`, `make test`, `make verify`,
  `make clean`).
- `scripts/install-hooks.sh` — idempotent installer for a pre-commit
  hook that runs `npm run typecheck && npm run test`.

### Changed

- Backend port and configuration standardized on the `ACE_PORT`
  environment variable (default `4318`).
- `npm run verify` extended to include the shells smoke test when
  the backend is reachable; skipped with a warning otherwise.
- `.gitignore` extended to cover `*.o`, `*.a`, `build/`, `dist/`,
  `target/`, `*.db`, `*.db-journal`, `.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`,
  `.idea/`.
- Touch target sizes standardized: `TouchButton` 64 / 80 / 96 px,
  `TouchIconButton` 72 px, launcher tiles 80 px+. Body text floor
  18 px; headings ≥ 24 px.
- App isolation: every `frontend/apps/*` is a separate workspace
  consumed by `desktop-shell` via dynamic `import()`.

### Removed

- "dev log" section of the old README; preserved in `DEVLOG.md`.

### Fixed

- WSOD recovery: kiosk shell reloads after 3 rapid crashes.
- `kiosk.sh` now routes to `?setup=1` when the wizard is pending.

### Known issues

- AI Tutor is a backend service only; the React app entry is
  registered but not shipped in v2 --beta.
- Several v1 errors remain in the historical issue tracker; see
  `DEVLOG.md` for the raw list.
